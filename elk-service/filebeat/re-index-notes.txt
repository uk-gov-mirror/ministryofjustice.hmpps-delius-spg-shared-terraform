1. Create a repair template  (copy of new template) with a new index name pattern to include the string repair
repair-spg-audit-template.json
local-repair-template.sh

This template will match all indexes with "repair" in the name

2. Add a new repair index pattern so we can separate the repaired indexes from the corrupt ones in Kibana
local-repair-index-pattern.sh

2. Reindex the old indexes to the new repair index - 
local-repair-reindex.sh
This will copy the existing corrupt indexes to new names with "repair" embedded in the index name
and therefpre they will pickup the index mappings from the repair-spg-audit-template

3. Verify that the new indexes have been created with the same number of records as the old ones
show_indices.sh

4. Remove the old indexes 
curl -k -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -XDELETE 'http://spg-elk-200:9200/spg-audit-7.1.1-2020*'

5. Create a new template with updated mappings - local-template.sh (with spg-audit-template.json)
